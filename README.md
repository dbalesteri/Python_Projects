# Python_Projects
This repository contains two main projects demonstrating multiple core Python and OOP concepts, as well as a few simple projects demonstrating a concept within it's title.

* [Phonebook App](#phonebook-app)
* [Recent File Transfer](#file-transfer)

* <a name="file-transfer"></a> Recent File Transfer:
  This project also uses Tkinter to build a graphical user interface, this time to interact with the computer's operating system to look for recently edited files in a chosen directory (modified less than 24 hours ago), and moving them to another.

### Side Projects:

* All other small projects were designed to learn basic Python and programming concepts.

* The name of the project will correspond with the concepts, with the exception of "nice_or_mean" which is a simple program involving loops, branching, and storing points for a basic text game.
